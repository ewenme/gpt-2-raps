March Madness
Future
Dress it up and make it real for me, hahaha
Whatever that fuckin' means
808 Mafia
Dirty soda in a styrofoam (yee)
Spend a day to get my mind blown (mind blown)
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 miles on the dash (woo!)
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
'Til these niggas started acting (we did it)
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gon' let 'em have it (we did)
We ballin' like the March Madness (let's get it)
All these cops shootin' niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's livin' lavish
Like I'm playin' for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch
The molly made me fuck her even though she average
Dirty muddy in a cup
The .45 by my gut
My young nigga in the cut
Taking you out for some Jordans
Let's count this money, no rushin'
I'm on a one way, flushin'
Loud pack smellin' musty
These fuckin' police can't touch me
These bogus police can't touch me
These fuckin' niggas can't touch me (Freeband Gang)
Apply the pressure with the VVS'
I drive the foreign like it was a Chevy
Drive the foreign like it was a Chevy (skrrt)
Lift it up and gon' and offset it
Fuck a cougar like she Halle Berry
Future Hendrix, Dirty Sprite, legendary (Dirty Sprite)
Dirty soda in a styrofoam (yee)
Spend a day to get my mind blown (mind blown)
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 miles on the dash (woo!)
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
'Til these niggas started acting (we did it)
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gon' let 'em have it (we did)
We ballin' like the March Madness (let's get it)
All these cops shootin' niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's livin' lavish
Like I'm playin' for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch
The molly made me fuck her even though she average
Fuck on a basic bitch
We gon' wake up and smoke us a blunt and fuck
She gon' keep it so real with a nigga that
I'ma come back and always gon' fuck with her
Bend the curve in a Spur like a MARTA bus
I was workin' and servin' in Nautica
I get high 'til I'm higher than Mercury
Fuck around, teach you that recipe
Fuck around, you gon' be out of here
Make her say huh like a nigga was Juve
Soon as that work hit the city, we move it
Post up in Onyx and shoot us a movie
Post up in Onyx and shoot us a movie
Take the tool inside the club
And just in case a nigga ever gotta use it
Get a pint of code' an pour it up, nigga
Dirty soda in a styrofoam (yee)
Spend a day to get my mind blown (mind blown)
Dress it up and go to NASA
200 miles on the dash (woo!)
And gotta roll a pound up and gas it
Switching lanes in a Grand Rapide
We the ones that kept it cool with all these niggas
'Til these niggas started acting (we did it)
Shoot a nigga like a film in a movie
Nigga, gon' let 'em have it (we did)
We ballin' like the March Madness (let's get it)
All these cops shootin' niggas, tragic
I'm the one that's livin' lavish
Like I'm playin' for the Mavericks
I didn't wanna fuck the bitch
The molly made me fuck her even though she average
These bogus police can't touch me
These fuckin' niggas can't touch me
Apply the pressure with the VVS'
I drive the foreign like it was a Chevy
Drive the foreign like it was a Chevy
Lift it up and gon' and offset it

Even though she average
