Hungry Hippo
Tierra Whack
He likes my diamonds and my pearls
I said, thank you I designed it
Not your average girl
He needed swag and I provided (‘vided)
Open up and bite it (bite it)
Open up and bite it (bite it)
Open up and bite it (bite it)
Shut up boy (bite it)
He don’t know no better, yeah
Heard he got that cheddar, yeah
Now that boy with me
He gon’ spend it better, yeah
Put him on that Alyx
Gucci on his wallet
Rick Owens on me
They think I’m his stylist
(Bite it)
He likes my diamonds and my pearls
I said, thank you I designed it
Not your average girl
